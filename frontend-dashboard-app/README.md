# Social Media Engagement Analyzer  

## Overview  
The Social Media Engagement Analyzer is a web application designed to help business professionals and content creators monetize their content and products by analyzing engagement metrics across various social media platforms, including YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, and others.   

## Features  
- **Engagement Analysis**: Visual representations (e.g., bar graphs) to identify which social media platforms yield the highest engagement for specific products or content.  
- **User Input**: Users can submit details about their products or content by providing links to the media where their products are advertised, including ads on platforms like Google and other websites.  
- **API Integration**: The application calls an API to fetch relevant data based on the provided links, which is then used for generating graphs and drawing analytical conclusions.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Frontend**: React  
- **Graphing Library**: Recharts  
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (optional)
